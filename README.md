# Citi-Skateboard-App
A skateboard version of citi-bike app

## Project Agenda
The city of NYC plans to deploy skateboard stations across town. Registered users can check out boards and stops and return them to other boards. You will implement the management system for this service. Your system will accept check-out/check-in reports, track the skateboards, answer queries about stations (e.g. empty/full) and be the backend for user registration. In addition you will support offline batch computation on logged data, and implement such a computation as a proof-of-contents. For example, you could run a batch job that generates a station-balancing report (how and where to move bikes).


## To-Do 
1. Analyze citi-bike app
2. List down all the features we will work on
3. Project design with Django framework
