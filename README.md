# Citi-Skateboard-App
A skateboard version of citi-bike app

## Project Agenda
The city of NYC plans to deploy skateboard stations across town. Registered users can check out boards and stops and return them to other boards. You will implement the management system for this service. Your system will accept check-out/check-in reports, track the skateboards, answer queries about stations (e.g. empty/full) and be the backend for user registration. In addition you will support offline batch computation on logged data, and implement such a computation as a proof-of-contents. For example, you could run a batch job that generates a station-balancing report (how and where to move bikes).

Project Design: A two to four pages Google doc describing exactly what you plan to do. The design will include the following information:
* The high level and detailed design. Best to include an architecture diagram in this section.
* The languages and technologies you intend to use (e.g. list the open source tools you intend to use).
* The exact scope of the project. What you intend to do and what you donâ€™t.
* The breakdown of tasks by project members. Who is in charge of what.
